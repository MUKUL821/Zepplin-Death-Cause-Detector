##### Adding notebooks:
You can add notebooks by making Github pull request, but we request you also update the table below by adding a record for your notebook. To generate the 'view' link for the notebook:

1. Uploading the notebook into this repo and obtain the url (it should look like this: https://github.com/MUKUL821/Zepplin-Death-Cause-Detector/blob/master/notebook/2BN4U3YA5/note.json)
2. Generate a link to preview the notebook by pasting the url from #1 into ZeppelinHub viewer (https://www.zeppelinhub.com/viewer). This will generate a preview page for your notebook (at a url that looks something like https://www.zeppelinhub.com/viewer/notebooks/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL01VS1VMODIxL1plcHBsaW4tRGVhdGgtQ2F1c2UtRGV0ZWN0b3IvbWFzdGVyL25vdGVib29rLzJCTjRVM1lBNS9ub3RlLmpzb24)
